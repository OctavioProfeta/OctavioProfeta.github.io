Here, at WorkingTeam2023â„¢, we want to know what are societal fears. So, what are we *afraid* of ? We are talking about societal fears, like the fear of a global pandemic or the fear of a nuclear war, not the fear of spiders or the fear of heights. [The Chapman University](https://www.chapman.edu/wilkinson/research-centers/babbie-center/survey-american-fears.aspx) conducts yearly studies based on surveys in the United States of America, giving us a starting point for an answer. By taking a look at the results of the surveys from 2018 to 2023, we have chosen to consider 7 majors global fears, which are the following :
*   War
*   Global Warming or Climate Change
*   Terrorism
*   Pandemics or Goblal Disease Outbreak
*   Economic Collapse
*   Technology Advancement
*   Aliens
