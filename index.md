Here, at WorkingTeam2023â„¢, we want to know what are societal fears. So, what are we *afraid* of ? We are talking about societal fears, like the fear of a global pandemic or the fear of a nuclear war, not the fear of spiders or the fear of heights. [The Chapman University](https://www.chapman.edu/wilkinson/research-centers/babbie-center/survey-american-fears.aspx) conducts yearly studies based on surveys in the United States of America, giving us a starting point for an answer. By taking a look at the results of the surveys from 2018 to 2023, we have chosen to consider 7 majors global fears, which are the following :
*   War
*   Global Warming or Climate Change
*   Terrorism
*   Pandemics or Goblal Disease Outbreak
*   Economic Collapse
*   Technology Advancement
*   Aliens

We want to know whereas these subjects appears in the cinema industry, and whether the movies treating them know some kind of success, aswell as point geographical and temporal trends.

## The datasets

We will be using the [Movie Summary Corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/), which is a dataset containing more than 42'000 movie plot summaries, aswell as some other corresponding metadata. Added to that is the IMDb, which contains information about film's box office.

## Ready, set... Analyse !

Hold on, hold on ! Let's first take a look at our data, and start by first seeing how many films have been produced through the years :
